          Our coffee shop uses only Ethiopian coffee. All commercially produced
          coffee originates from Ethiopia. We love Ethiopia for providing the
          world with coffee to grow, and we continue to love the flavor of that
          countryâ€™s coffee. The fruity acidity of this single-origin coffee is
          balanced by its sweet honey notes, creating soft, light notes with a
          light character.
